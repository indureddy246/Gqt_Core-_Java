Core Java Programs — GQT

This repository contains a collection of Core Java programs that I practiced during my training at Global Quest Technologies (GQT) while preparing for placements. The programs cover important fundamental topics such as input and output, operators, control statements, loops, arrays, strings, recursion, and various number-based problems.

Working on these programs helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and understanding of basic Java concepts. Many of these problems are commonly asked in coding tests, technical interviews, and campus placement rounds for entry-level software roles.

This repository can be useful for students and beginners who are preparing for placements and want to revise Core Java fundamentals through practice programs. It can also serve as a reference for quick revision before coding tests or interviews.
